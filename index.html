  <section id="about">
    <h2>About</h2>
    <p> Hello! My name is Drik and I am a curious Front-End Web Developer and Application Developer. I am passionate about implementing technology into daily life to not only make life easier for all, but make it as affordable as possible! My goal since childhood was always to help people, and those who cannot afford certain things, provide them the experience to enjoy luxuries of life. Now how is that relevant with web development? well, through my work -- building modern and sleek websites at a very affordable cost -- I not only help people by donating a portion of my earnings (irrelevant), but also aid them with technological advancements such as programming a e.g. fitness tracker so they can use it for their wellbeing for absolutely free.

<br>Beyond my work, I pursue independent studies in politics, interpersonal communication, psychology, and world economics, while also developing skills in financial literacy, writing, and music. I am passionate about learning, disciplined execution, and creating meaningful work that reflects both purpose and innovation.</p>
